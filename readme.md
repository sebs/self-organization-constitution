> Extreme Programming emphasizes teamwork. Managers, customers, and developers are all equal partners in a collaborative team. Extreme Programming implements a simple, yet effective environment enabling teams to become highly productive. The team self-organizes around the problem to solve it as efficiently as possible. 



The primary self-organization constitution document is [here](CONSTITUTION.md).

**Note:** This version of the constitution is new and being vetted by pioneering organizations. Your feedback as a pioneer, practitioner, or engaged observer is very welcome.

###Principles

* **Distribute Authority** - Members are free to take actions that further the organization's purpose by default.
* **Evolve** - Define organizational rules and roles iteratively based on the challenges that members experience. Make progress even over perfection.
* **Evidence** - Base decisions and actions on evidence.

### XP Principles

* **Rapid Feedback** - We try to keep feedback cycles short, in order to adopt fast
* **Assume Simplicity** - Architectures and Processes should be simple to use and easy to understand
* **Incremental Change** - We are constantly evolving the organisation and the architecture of the software
* **Embracing Change** - We need to welcome change and not resist it. 
* **Quality Work** - High quality work leads to low turnover and less re-work. This is the only theing that helps efficiency and effectiveness at once. 

###Why is this constitution needed?

Your group of 2-20 people needs a clear way to fulfill its purpose, make decisions, get things done, and respond to change.
* To fit your values your constitution must be egalitarian.
* In order to respond to change and adapt to your unique context you must be able to evolve your constitution.
* To learn from other groups you need to be able to share innovations freely.
* In order to build capacity rapidly with changing team members your constitution must also be simple.

If this is what you are looking for, [this constitution](CONSTITUTION.md) is for you.

###How do you adopt this constitution?

1. Each member of the organization defines roles based on the activities they are currently doing. The mission holders of the organization define the purpose & values through a process they choose.
2. Grant the roles defined by the organization's members and the default roles: Role Assigner, Facilitator, and Treasurer. Remember, roles can be held by multiple people and people can hold multiple roles.
3. Have those with sufficient authority ratify the constitution for self-organization.
4. Have regular meetings to make proposals. Document the proposals in the adopted proposal section below.

###Why are there no circles or groups defined in the constitution?

The focus of this constitution is for small groups of 2-20. There are several design patterns for scaling. Rather than biasing in one direction or another at the outset, the constitution gives space for the organization to evolve.

Two potential scaling patterns are: nested holonic circle structures as employed by Sociocracy & Holacracy; and networked structures such as Morning Star's [Colleague Letter of Understanding (CLOU)](http://www.managementexchange.com/story/colleague-letter-understanding-replacing-jobs-commitments).

If you would like to contribute scaling "proposal pattern", your contributions would be welcome. For example you could contribute a sociocracy style double linked circle "proposal pattern".
